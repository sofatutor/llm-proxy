# Admin UI not implemented

PLAN.md lists an Admin UI as a core component and deliverable:
```
- **Admin UI**: Web interface for managing projects and tokens
```
【F:PLAN.md†L24-L30】

However the repository only contains a placeholder README in `internal/admin/` with no implementation. Add the Admin UI handlers, templates and authentication as described in the plan.
