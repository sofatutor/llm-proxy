# Benchmark tool incomplete

PLAN.md describes a command line benchmark tool as a deliverable to measure latency and throughput:
```
- **Benchmark Tool**: CLI for measuring latency, throughput, and errors
```
【F:PLAN.md†L24-L30】

The current implementation `cmd/benchmark/main.go` only prints a placeholder message and lacks any benchmarking functionality. Implement the benchmark tool according to the plan.
