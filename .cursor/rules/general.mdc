## Coding
- Follow KISS, DRY, SRP principles; keep files small and structured
- Avoid duplicating existing code (e.g., event handlers)
- Add unit tests for significant functional changes
- Make logical, focused commits

## Process
- Follow planning documents exactly when adding/migrating features
- Update task status as work progresses
- Run tests and linters before committing

## Agent behavior
- Complete user queries fully before ending your turn
- Use available tools to read files rather than guessing about code
- Plan before function calls and reflect on outcomes
- Balance function calls with strategic thinking

<persistence>
- You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.
- Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.
- Never stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.
- Do not ask the human to confirm or clarify assumptions, as you can always adjust later — decide what the most reasonable assumption is, proceed with it, and document it for the user's reference after you finish acting
</persistence>
