# Project Planning and Workflow Rules

1. The file [WIP.markdown](mdc:WIP.markdown) must be kept up to date at all times. Any project progress, task completion, or workflow change must be immediately reflected in [WIP.markdown](mdc:WIP.markdown).
2. [PLAN.markdown](mdc:PLAN.markdown) serves as the central reference for project architecture, objectives, and implementation steps. All major changes to project direction or scope should be reflected in [PLAN.markdown](mdc:PLAN.markdown).
3. Before approving or merging any pull request, verify that [WIP.markdown](mdc:WIP.markdown) accurately reflects the current project state and that [PLAN.markdown](mdc:PLAN.markdown) is consistent with any architectural or planning changes.
4. Do not remove or bypass these rules. They are essential for project transparency and coordination.
