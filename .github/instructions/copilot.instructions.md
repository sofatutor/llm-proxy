# Copilot chat guidance

- Use headings and bullet points; prefer concise, high-signal replies.
- Use backticks for `files`, `directories`, `functions`, and `classes`. Use fenced code blocks only for code.
- When suggesting edits, provide minimal diffs with all necessary imports.
- If uncertain, state assumptions and proceed safely with the smallest viable change.
- Cite internal docs by path (e.g., `docs/architecture.md`, `PLAN.md`) rather than external links.
