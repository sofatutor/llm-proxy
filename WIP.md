# WIP: Admin UI Foundation Implementation (PR #19)

# WIP: OpenAI Token Counting Bugfix (2025-05-27)

# WIP: Async Event Bus, Dispatcher, and Persistent Event Logging (PR #34)

## Summary
- Fixed a bug in OpenAI event transformation where `completion_tokens` and `prompt_tokens` were incorrectly calculated.
- Previously, token counts were computed over the entire response/request JSON, not just the relevant content.
- Now, `completion_tokens` are counted only from the assistant's reply content (`choices[0].message.content`), and `prompt_tokens` from the request's `messages` array (if present).
- Added a helper (`extractAssistantReplyContent`) and comprehensive unit tests for edge/error cases.
- All changes are covered by tests and maintain 90%+ code coverage.
- See PLAN.md for rationale and architecture.

## Details
- Bug: Error responses and non-completion responses resulted in nonzero or inflated completion token counts.
- Fix: Only count tokens in the actual assistant reply content. If not present, set completion tokens to zero.
- Tests: Added table-driven tests for the new helper, covering normal, error, empty, and malformed cases.
- All tests pass (`go test -v ./internal/eventtransformer/...`).

# WIP: Async Event Bus, Dispatcher, and Persistent Event Logging (PR #34)

## Summary
- Implemented a fully asynchronous event bus architecture with both InMemoryEventBus and RedisEventBus backends, supporting multiple subscribers (fan-out), batching, retry logic, and graceful shutdown.
- Added a dispatcher CLI and `--file-event-log` flag for persistent event logging to JSONL files.
- Middleware now captures and restores the request body for all events, and the event context is richer for diagnostics and debugging.
- The event bus is always enabled by default, with a larger buffer for high-throughput scenarios.
- OpenAI token counting bug fixed: `completion_tokens` are now counted only from the assistant's reply, and `prompt_tokens` from the request's `messages` array, using tiktoken-go for accuracy.
- All changes are covered by comprehensive unit tests and maintain 90%+ code coverage.
- See PLAN.md for architectural details and rationale.

## Details
- Event bus and dispatcher are now the foundation for all observability and analytics in the proxy.
- Persistent event logging is handled by the dispatcher CLI or the `--file-event-log` flag.
- All event delivery is async, batched, and non-blocking, with robust error handling and retry logic.
- Migration note: The event bus is now always enabled; configuration options have changed. See PLAN.md and README.md for updated usage and configuration.

> **Note:** All detailed development tasks for Phases 4–7 are now tracked in individual issue files in `docs/issues/`. This WIP.md will serve as a high-level status and index. All future development, tracking, and progress updates will be managed via the issue files. Please refer to the linked issues for detailed tasks, rationale, and acceptance criteria.

# LLM Proxy Implementation Checklist

> **Agent-Driven Test-Driven Development (TDD) Mandate**
>
> This project is implemented entirely by autonomous agents. All development MUST strictly follow test-driven development (TDD):
> - Every feature or change must first be implemented as a failing unit test.
> - Only after the test is written may the implementation be created or modified to make the test pass.
> - No code may be merged unless it is covered by tests.
> - A minimum of 90% code coverage is required at all times, enforced by GitHub Actions.
> - Pull requests must demonstrate that new/changed code is covered by tests and that overall coverage remains above 90%.
> - Coverage checks are mandatory in CI and must block merges if not met.

> See PLAN.md for the canonical coverage policy and rationale.

This document provides a detailed sequential implementation checklist for the Transparent LLM Proxy for OpenAI. Tasks are organized into phases with dependencies clearly marked. Each task has a status indicator:

- [ ] TODO: Task not yet started
- [ ] IN PROGRESS: Task currently being implemented
- [ ] SKIPPED: Task temporarily skipped
- [x] DONE: Task completed

## Outstanding Review Comments

See DONE.md for all completed review comments. Only unresolved or in-progress comments are tracked here.

## Pull Request Strategy

All completed PR strategy tasks have been moved to DONE.md. Only new or in-progress strategy changes will be tracked here.

## Phase 0: Pre-Development Setup

**Abstract:**
Initial repository setup, GitHub configuration, development environment, and CI/CD were fully established. See DONE.md for all completed setup and project management tasks.

## Phase 1: Project Setup

**Abstract:**
Repository structure, configuration, Docker, security, documentation, and foundational testing were implemented. All core project scaffolding and best practices are in place. See DONE.md for details.

## Phase 2: Core Components

**Abstract:**
Core database implementation, token management system, and proxy logic completed. All fundamental functionality implemented with comprehensive testing. See DONE.md for detailed implementation checklist.

### CLI Tool (Setup & OpenAI Chat)
- [x] Implement CLI tool (`llm-proxy setup` and `llm-proxy openai chat`) **in a separate PR** (`feature/llm-proxy-cli`)
  - CLI tool structure and commands design
  - Basic CLI framework with flag parsing
  - 'llm-proxy setup' command for configuration with these improvements:
    - Automatic project creation and token generation
    - Secure random token generation for MANAGEMENT_TOKEN
    - Ability to skip through existing settings in interactive mode
    - Preserving existing configuration values
  - 'llm-proxy openai chat' command with advanced features:
    - Streaming mode for real-time responses
    - Verbose mode for displaying timing information
    - Shows proxy overhead compared to remote call duration
  - 'llm-proxy server' command with daemon mode (-d option) and PID file support
  - 'llm-proxy admin' command for Admin UI server (renamed from admin-server, moved to separate admin.go file)
  - Advanced CLI flag parsing and configuration overrides
  - Comprehensive end-to-end usage documentation and advanced examples
  - Test cases for CLI tool verification (expanded with extracted functionality tests) **[COMPLETED]**
  - Documentation for CLI usage (needs update for new features) **[IN PROGRESS]**
  - **Management API CLI is now fully configurable via --manage-api-base-url; 'token get' subcommand is implemented.**
  - **Planned:** Add more integration specs for management API flows.

#### CLI Usage Example
```sh
llm-proxy manage project list --manage-api-base-url http://localhost:8080 --management-token <token>
llm-proxy manage token generate --project-id <project-id> --management-token <token> --manage-api-base-url http://localhost:8080
llm-proxy manage token get <token> --management-token <token> --manage-api-base-url http://localhost:8080 --json
```

## IN PROGRESS: CLI Management Command for Projects and Tokens

A new `llm-proxy manage` command will be introduced to provide a clear, user-friendly CLI for project and token management. This command will support CRUD operations for projects and token generation/validation, separated from setup and server commands for clarity and best practices.

### Command Structure

- `llm-proxy manage project <subcommand>`
  - `list` — List all projects
  - `get <project-id>` — Get details for a project
  - `create --name <name> --openai-key <key>` — Create a new project
  - `update <project-id> [--name ...] [--openai-key ...]` — Update a project
  - `delete <project-id>` — Delete a project

- `llm-proxy manage token <subcommand>`
  - `generate --project-id <id> --duration <hours>` — Generate a new token for a project
  - `get <token>` — Get validity/status for a token

### Output Format
- By default, results are shown in a human-friendly table.
- Use `--json` flag for machine-readable JSON output.

### Rationale
- Keeps setup and management concerns separate for clarity and maintainability.
- Follows CLI and Go best practices (SRP, discoverability, UX).
- Makes it easy for both humans and scripts to use the CLI.

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] Scaffold `manage` command and subcommands in CLI
- [x] Implement project CRUD subcommands (list, get, create, update, delete)
- [x] Implement token subcommands (generate, get)
- [x] Wire subcommands to management API endpoints (`/manage/projects`, `/manage/tokens`)
- [x] Require management token for all manage commands (flag or env)
- [x] Print results as table by default, with `--json` for machine output
- [x] Add tests for CLI manage commands
- [x] Document usage in CLI README

## Dependencies

- Phase 0 must be completed before Phase 1
- Phase 1 must be completed before Phase 2
- Database Implementation must be completed before Token Management System
- Token Management System must be completed before Management API Endpoints
- Proxy Logic must be completed before Proxy API Endpoints
- Core Components (Phase 2) must be completed before API and Interfaces (Phase 3)
- Logging System should be implemented early but can be enhanced incrementally
- Testing can begin after individual components are implemented
- Benchmark Tool requires Proxy API to be functional
- Containerization can start after core functionality is implemented
- Optimization should be done after basic functionality is working

## Timeline

- Phase 0-1: Day 1
- Phase 2: Days 1-2
- Phase 3-4: Days 3-4
- Phase 5-6: Days 5-6
- Phase 7: Days 7-8

- [x] Fix unchecked error returns in tests flagged by golangci-lint
- [x] Update GitHub Actions workflow to use correct golangci-lint version and options
- [x] Restrict Docker builds to main branch and tags only

**Note:** SQLite is used for MVP, local, and development deployments. PostgreSQL will be evaluated and tested for production use before launch. The codebase and schema should remain portable between both database engines.

## Current Focus
- The proxy architecture is now explicitly generic, designed to support any API requiring secure, short-lived (withering) tokens and transparent proxying. OpenAI is used as a case study for the MVP.
- ✅ Implementation of a YAML-based configuration system for API provider endpoints and methods. Configuration supports multiple providers and is extensible.
- ✅ The proxy performs minimal, necessary request/response transformations (e.g., Authorization header replacement) while extracting useful metadata (token counts, model information).
- ✅ Streaming responses are properly handled with transparent pass-through, maintaining the streaming nature of the API.
- ✅ **PHASE 3 COMPLETE:** Management API endpoints and Admin UI Foundation implemented
  - Management API with full CRUD operations (PR18)
  - Complete Admin UI with integrated `admin` command (PR19)
  - Security-focused design with modern Bootstrap interface
  - CLI integration and configuration system
- ✅ **CODE ORGANIZATION IMPROVEMENTS:** Enhanced testability and maintainability
  - Extracted business logic from cmd/ to internal/ packages for better testability
  - Improved test coverage from 67.0% → 68.9% with comprehensive unit tests
  - Fixed race conditions and test failures
  - Organized admin command in dedicated file with proper graceful shutdown
- The next focus areas are:
  - **Phase 4:** Logging and Monitoring system implementation
  - **Phase 5:** Comprehensive testing and performance optimization
  - **Optional enhancements:** Real-time updates, advanced UI features

## Remaining Configuration Tasks
- [ ] Expand provider config and YAML changes (document and test) - *moved to Phase 4/5*

// Note: Linter/staticcheck/errcheck issues for proxy and server resolved. Test race conditions and failures fixed. Coverage improved with extracted functionality testing.

## 2025-05-24: Benchmark Tool Core Implemented
- Implemented the core architecture for the benchmark tool in `cmd/proxy`.
- CLI now supports required flags: `--base-url`, `--endpoint`, `--token`, `--requests`, `--concurrency`.
- Added concurrent request handling with worker pool logic.
- Implemented initial request generator for supported endpoints.
- Added and updated tests for CLI, concurrency, and request generation (TDD followed).
- Integrated `make test-benchmark` for targeted test runs.
- All tests passing (`make test-benchmark`).
- Updated process and rationale per working agreement.
