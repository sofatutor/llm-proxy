## LLM Proxy

Open-source reverse proxy for LLM APIs with withering tokens, management UI, and observability.

### Why LLM Proxy?

- Transparent proxying to OpenAI‑compatible endpoints
- Short‑lived withering tokens with project‑scoped access control
- Admin UI for projects, tokens, and audit trails
- Async event system with pluggable dispatcher integrations (file, Lunary, Helicone)
