## Introduction / Overview

Create a static GitHub Pages site to market the LLM Proxy as an open‑source project and attract contributors. The site will be hosted from the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch using GitHub Pages’ default Jekyll pipeline. It highlights the project’s purpose, core features, screenshots of the Admin UI, quickstart instructions, links to architecture docs, a clear contributing path, and an automatically updated coverage sub‑page.

Context and references:
- Project overview and workflows: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/README.md`
- Architecture and components: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api-configuration.md`, `docs/instrumentation.md`, `docs/cli-reference.md`
- Testing and coverage: Makefile targets; CI-style coverage aggregation rules

## Goals

- Publish a simple, fast marketing site at `https://sofatutor.github.io/llm-proxy` (GitHub Pages, `docs/` on `main`).
- Communicate value clearly and invite contributions (badges, CTA, links to issues and CONTRIBUTING).
- Provide live code coverage as a sub‑page updated on each push to `main`.
- Showcase Admin UI with screenshots.
- Keep maintenance easy: pure static content in `docs/` with minimal tooling.

Measurable targets:
- Lighthouse Performance ≥ 95 on the homepage.
- First contentful paint < 1.5s on desktop for `docs/index.html`.
- Coverage sub‑page auto-updates on every push to `main` and is linked from the navbar.
- Badges (build, tests, coverage) visible above the fold.

## User Stories

- As a prospective contributor, I can quickly understand the project, see the roadmap, and find “good first issues” and contributing steps.
- As an engineer evaluating the project, I can view features, architecture overview, and coverage trend to gauge quality.
- As a maintainer, I can update site content by editing Markdown/HTML in `docs/` without additional frameworks.

## Functional Requirements

1. Hosting & Structure
   - Host via GitHub Pages using the `docs/` directory on `main` (default Jekyll pipeline; no custom branch).
   - Top-level navigation items: Home, Features, Screenshots, Quickstart, Architecture, Contributing, Coverage, Roadmap.
   - Footer links: GitHub repo, Issues, License, Security, Privacy (link to relevant repo docs where applicable).

2. Homepage (docs/index.html or index.md)
   - Clear value proposition for LLM Proxy and key feature highlights.
   - Prominent “Contributors welcome” CTA linking to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, open issues (filtered by good‑first‑issue), and roadmap docs.
   - Build/test/coverage badges displayed above the fold.

3. Features Page (docs/features.md)
   - Bullet summaries of core features: Transparent Proxying, Withering Tokens, Project-based Access Control, Async Event System, Admin Management, Observability.
   - Links into deeper docs (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/instrumentation.md`, `docs/api-configuration.md`).

4. Screenshots Page (docs/screenshots.md)
   - Showcase Admin UI screens (Login, Dashboard, Projects, Tokens, Audit).
   - Images sourced from `docs/assets/screenshots/` with canonical filenames: `login.png`, `dashboard.png`, `projects.png`, `tokens.png`, `audit.png`.

5. Quickstart Page (docs/quickstart.md)
   - Minimal setup: build binary, `llm-proxy setup`, `llm-proxy server`, `llm-proxy admin`.
   - Example API call and/or `openai chat` usage via proxy.
   - Link to `docs/cli-reference.md`.

6. Architecture Page (docs/architecture.md)
   - Reuse existing repository document; provide a concise intro and link to full doc.

7. Contributing Page (docs/contributing.md)
   - Summarize key points from `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, testing/coverage standards (≥ 90%), and PR discipline.
   - Links to good-first issues, CODEOWNERS (if present), and working agreement.

8. Coverage Sub‑Page (docs/coverage/index.html)
   - CI pipeline publishes HTML coverage report into `docs/coverage/` on successful pushes to `main`.
   - Navbar “Coverage” links to this sub‑page.
   - Do not commit large historical artifacts; overwrite the folder each update.

9. Badges
   - Display build, tests, and coverage badges on the homepage using GitHub Actions badge URLs and a coverage badge generated by CI.

10. Visual & Accessibility
   - Clean, modern static styling (plain CSS) consistent across pages; mobile-responsive.
   - Social meta tags (Open Graph, Twitter) for better link previews.
   - No JS framework required; default Jekyll is acceptable but not required for authoring.

11. Assets & Screenshots
   - Place images under `docs/assets/screenshots/` (e.g., `dashboard.png`, `projects.png`, `tokens.png`, `audit.png`).
   - Optimize images for web (≤ 200 KB each where possible).

12. SEO Basics
   - Descriptive titles and meta descriptions per page.
   - `sitemap.xml` generation via Jekyll plugin or a static file (optional).

## Non‑Goals (Out of Scope)

- No dynamic backend or client-side app framework.
- No multi-language content (English only for this iteration).
- No blog, changelog automation, or search integration in this iteration.
- No custom domain/CNAME (keep default `sofatutor.github.io/llm-proxy`).

## Design Considerations

- Keep it simple: static pages with minimal CSS; default Jekyll pipeline is fine.
- Reuse the Admin UI’s visual vibe subtly without coupling; small accent gradient ok.
- Ensure links to repo docs remain stable; prefer relative links within `docs/`.
- Favor maintainability over heavy theming.

## Technical Considerations

- GitHub Pages configuration: enable Pages with source “Deploy from a branch → `main` / `docs/`”.
- Directory layout (initial suggestion):
  - `docs/index.md`
  - `docs/features.md`
  - `docs/screenshots.md`
  - `docs/quickstart.md`
  - `docs/contributing.md`
  - `docs/coverage/index.html` (generated by CI)
  - `docs/assets/screenshots/` (image files)
  - Optional: `docs/_config.yml` for Jekyll (title, description, theme, plugins).
- Coverage publishing:
  - CI job runs tests with CI-style coverage aggregation and generates HTML report.
  - Copy or rsync HTML artifacts into `docs/coverage/` and commit back to `main` on success (with appropriate safeguards to avoid looped triggers).
  - Alternatively, push via a dedicated bot user/token; filter workflow triggers to avoid re-running on the coverage-only commit (e.g., `paths-ignore`).

## Success Metrics

- `make test` green (incl. `-race`) in CI.
- Coverage ≥ 90% and HTML coverage published under `docs/coverage/` on every push to `main`.
- Pages deployed and accessible at `https://sofatutor.github.io/llm-proxy` with navbar, badges, and screenshots rendered.
- Lighthouse Perf ≥ 95 on homepage; basic a11y checks pass.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GitHub Pages is enabled for `docs/` on `main`; a visible homepage with nav exists.
- Home, Features, Screenshots, Quickstart, Architecture, Contributing, Coverage, Roadmap pages are present and interlinked.
- Badges for build, tests, and coverage are visible on the homepage.
- Screenshots render from `docs/assets/screenshots/`.
- CI pipeline updates `docs/coverage/` on each push to `main` (and does not create infinite workflow loops).

## Open Questions

- None for v1 (answered):
  - Source: `docs/` on `main`.
  - Framework: default Jekyll.
  - Style: creative but lightweight.
  - Nav: Home, Features, Screenshots, Quickstart, Architecture, Contributing, Coverage, Roadmap.
  - Coverage: sub‑page under `docs/coverage/`, updated on `main`.
  - Badges: yes.
  - Screenshots: under `docs/assets/`.
  - CTA-focused messaging: yes.
  - Language: English only.
  - Domain: keep default GitHub Pages domain.

## Notes for Implementation (non-binding)

- Create initial Markdown/HTML pages under `docs/` per structure above.
- Add `docs/_config.yml` with site metadata and a simple theme (optional: `minima`).
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow to:
  - Run tests with CI-style coverage aggregation.
  - Generate HTML coverage (e.g., `go tool cover -html=coverage_ci.txt -o coverage.html` or use `go tool cover` per-package HTML and an index page).
  - Publish to `docs/coverage/` and commit changes on `main` safely (use `paths-ignore`/conditional to avoid loops).
- Place the captured Admin UI images into `docs/assets/screenshots/` and reference them in `docs/screenshots.md` and homepage.
