# GitHub Copilot Agent Environment Setup

This document describes the development environment configuration for GitHub Copilot Agent in the llm-proxy project.

## Overview

The GitHub Copilot Agent environment has been configured to provide:
- Optimized development workflow matching our CI/CD pipelines
- Network access to GitHub documentation and APIs
- Efficient caching for faster development cycles
- Consistent tooling and dependencies

## Environment Configuration

### Firewall Configuration

The Copilot Agent firewall has been configured to allow access to essential GitHub services:

```yaml
COPILOT_AGENT_FIREWALL_ALLOW_LIST_ADDITIONS: "https://docs.github.com,https://api.github.com,https://raw.githubusercontent.com"
```

This configuration allows the agent to:
- ✅ Access GitHub documentation for research and guidance
- ✅ Interact with GitHub APIs for repository operations
- ✅ Fetch raw content from GitHub repositories

### Development Environment

The environment mirrors our existing GitHub Actions workflows with:

- **Go Version**: 1.23 (matches build.yml, test.yml, lint.yml)
- **Node.js Version**: 20 (for frontend tooling)
- **OS**: Ubuntu Latest (consistent with CI/CD)
- **Caching**: Enabled for Go modules, build cache, and development tools
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`

### Available Tools

The environment includes all development tools specified in our Makefile:
- `golangci-lint` for code linting
- `swag` for API documentation generation
- `godoc` for Go documentation
- `mockgen` for test mocks

## Usage

### Manual Trigger

The Copilot Agent environment can be manually set up using the workflow dispatch:

1. Go to the Actions tab in the repository
2. Select "Copilot Setup Steps" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Optionally provide a task description

### Automatic Setup

The environment setup runs automatically when:
- A Copilot Agent task is assigned
- Development environment validation is needed

## Validation

The environment includes comprehensive validation:

- **Network Connectivity**: Verifies access to whitelisted domains
- **Tool Availability**: Confirms all required development tools are installed
- **Build Verification**: Ensures the project builds successfully
- **Test Execution**: Runs the full test suite
- **Code Quality**: Performs linting and formatting checks

## Cache Strategy

The environment uses multi-level caching for optimal performance:

1. **Go Module Cache**: Caches downloaded dependencies
2. **Build Cache**: Caches compiled artifacts
3. **Tool Cache**: Caches development tools
4. **Test Results Cache**: Caches test outputs and coverage reports

Cache keys are prefixed with `copilot-agent` for easy identification and management.

## Environment Variables

### Core Configuration
- `GO_VERSION`: Go language version
- `NODE_VERSION`: Node.js version for tooling
- `CACHE_KEY_PREFIX`: Cache identification prefix

### Security Configuration
- `COPILOT_AGENT_FIREWALL_ALLOW_LIST_ADDITIONS`: Network access whitelist

## Troubleshooting

### Network Access Issues

If the Copilot Agent reports network access issues:

1. Verify the firewall allowlist includes required domains
2. Check the environment validation logs
3. Ensure the workflow has necessary permissions

### Build Issues

If builds fail in the Copilot Agent environment:

1. Compare with CI/CD workflow configurations
2. Check cache status and clear if necessary
3. Verify Go and Node.js versions match specifications

### Performance Issues

If the environment is slow:

1. Check cache hit rates in workflow logs
2. Verify concurrent job limitations
3. Review timeout configurations

## Integration with Existing Workflows

The Copilot Agent environment is designed to complement, not replace, existing workflows:

- **build.yml**: Build validation and binary creation
- **test.yml**: Comprehensive testing (unit and integration)
- **lint.yml**: Code quality and formatting
- **docker.yml**: Container image building and publishing

The agent environment provides a development-focused setup that mirrors these production workflows while optimizing for interactive development tasks.

## Repository Variables

For organization-wide configuration, set these GitHub Actions variables:

```yaml
# Required for all repositories using Copilot Agent
COPILOT_AGENT_FIREWALL_ALLOW_LIST_ADDITIONS: "https://docs.github.com,https://api.github.com,https://raw.githubusercontent.com"

# Optional: Disable firewall completely (NOT RECOMMENDED for production)
# COPILOT_AGENT_FIREWALL_ENABLED: false

# Optional: Complete firewall override (replaces default allowlist)
# COPILOT_AGENT_FIREWALL_ALLOW_LIST: "custom.domain.com,another.domain.com"
```

## Security Considerations

- The firewall allowlist is limited to essential GitHub services
- No external domains beyond GitHub are included by default
- Full firewall bypass is NOT enabled for security reasons
- All network access is logged and auditable through workflow runs

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Dynamic environment scaling based on task complexity
- Integration with code coverage reporting
- Custom toolchain support for specific project types
- Enhanced caching strategies for monorepo structures
