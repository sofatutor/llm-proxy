# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for deploying, configuring, and using the LLM Proxy.

## Secrets Management

### API Keys

- **Never hardcode** API keys or sensitive credentials in source code
- Store API keys in environment variables or secure secrets management systems
- Rotate API keys periodically (recommended: every 30-90 days)
- Use different API keys for development, testing, and production environments
- Consider implementing API key encryption at rest in the database

### Environment Variables

- Store sensitive configuration in `.env` files for local development
- **Never commit** `.env` files to version control
- Use secrets management services in production (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- Restrict environment variable access to only the necessary processes
- Implement validation for required environment variables before application startup

## Token Security

### Management Token

- Use a cryptographically secure random generator for the management token
  ```bash
  # Generate a secure random token
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
- Rotate the management token periodically
- Store the management token securely and limit access to authorized personnel
- Consider IP restrictions for management API access

### Access Tokens

- Implement appropriate lifetimes for access tokens (recommended: 30 days or less)
- Enforce token expiration and provide secure refresh mechanisms
- Store token hashes rather than the tokens themselves when possible
- Implement rate limiting per token to prevent abuse
- Enable token revocation and maintain a blocklist for revoked tokens
- Track token usage and implement anomaly detection

## Container Security

### Non-Root Container Execution

The Dockerfile is configured to run as a non-root user:
- Application runs as `appuser` with restricted permissions
- File permissions are set to minimal required access
- Volumes are owned by the non-root user

### Container Hardening

- Use the latest base images and keep them updated
- Remove unnecessary packages and utilities from the container
- Set appropriate file permissions (principle of least privilege)
- Enable security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Use security-focused linters for Dockerfiles
- Implement container runtime security (seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux)

### Docker Recommendations

- Run containers with read-only filesystem where possible
- Limit container resources (CPU, memory)
- Use user namespaces to further isolate container processes
- Implement container-level network policies
- Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment

## Network Security

### TLS Configuration

- Always enable HTTPS in production with proper TLS certificates
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher (TLS 1.3 preferred)
- Configure secure cipher suites
- Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Consider using Let's Encrypt for certificate automation

### API Security

- Implement strict CORS policies (avoid wildcard `*` origins in production)
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Return appropriate error codes without leaking sensitive information
- Implement request timeout to prevent DoS attacks

## Logging and Monitoring

### Secure Logging

- Mask sensitive data in logs (API keys, tokens, personal information)
- Implement structured logging for better analysis
- Set appropriate log levels (avoid DEBUG in production)
- Secure log storage and transmission
- Implement log rotation and retention policies

### Security Monitoring

- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Set up alerts for potential security incidents
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
- Regularly review access logs
- Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Regular Security Practices

- Update dependencies regularly to patch security vulnerabilities
- Conduct security code reviews
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all components
- Document and test incident response procedures

## Development Security

- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Keep security dependencies updated
