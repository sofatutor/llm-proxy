# Performance Profiling

## Summary
Profile the LLM proxy application to identify performance bottlenecks, create benchmark baselines, document performance issues, and plan optimization strategies. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other optimization and production readiness issues.

## Rationale
- Performance profiling is essential for identifying and addressing bottlenecks that impact latency and throughput.
- Benchmark baselines provide a reference for future optimizations and regressions.

## Tasks
- [ ] Profile the application to identify CPU, memory, I/O, and network bottlenecks
- [ ] Create benchmark baselines for key operations and endpoints
- [ ] Document identified performance issues and their impact
- [ ] Plan and prioritize optimization strategies
- [ ] Add tests or scripts for ongoing performance profiling

## Acceptance Criteria
- Performance bottlenecks are identified and documented
- Benchmark baselines are established
- Optimization strategies are planned and prioritized
- Documentation and profiling scripts are available
