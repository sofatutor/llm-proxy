- Backup, restore, and disaster recovery ensure data safety and business continuity.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement a scheduled token cleanup job
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown handling for the proxy and admin server
- [ ] Create backup and restore procedures for database and configuration
- [ ] Document disaster recovery process
- [ ] Add tests for operational features

## Acceptance Criteria
- Token cleanup, graceful shutdown, and backup/restore are implemented and tested
- Disaster recovery process is documented
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
