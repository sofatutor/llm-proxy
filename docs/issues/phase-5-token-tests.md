# Token Management Tests

## Summary
Token management tests are already present due to ongoing TDD. This issue remains open to further DRY up, refactor, and ensure comprehensive and efficient coverage of all token management logic, keeping coverage above 90% at all times.

## Rationale
- TDD has ensured a strong baseline, but further refactoring can improve test efficiency and maintainability.
- DRYing up and consolidating tests reduces duplication and improves reliability.
- Coverage must remain above 90% at all times.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review and refactor existing token management tests for DRYness and efficiency
- [ ] Ensure all token management logic and edge cases are covered
- [ ] Maintain and improve test coverage reporting
- [ ] Document token management testing best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- Token management tests are DRY, efficient, and comprehensive
- Coverage remains above 90% at all times
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
