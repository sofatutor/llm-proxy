# Container Orchestration (Index)

## Summary
Container orchestration for the LLM proxy is now split into two focused tracks:

- [AWS ECS Deployment](docs/issues/planned/phase-6-aws-ecs.md)
- [Kubernetes Deployment with HELM](docs/issues/planned/phase-6-kubernetes-helm.md)

Please refer to the above issue files for detailed tasks, rationale, and acceptance criteria for each orchestration platform.
