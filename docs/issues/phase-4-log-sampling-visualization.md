# Log Sampling and Visualization

## Summary
Implement log sampling for high-volume deployments and create recommendations or utilities for log visualization. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other logging and monitoring enhancements.

## Rationale
- Log sampling reduces storage and processing overhead in high-volume environments.
- Visualization tools and recommendations help users gain insights from logs efficiently.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement log sampling strategies (e.g., random, rate-based)
- [ ] Add configuration options for enabling/disabling and tuning log sampling
- [ ] Research and recommend log visualization tools compatible with JSONL logs
- [ ] (Optional) Implement basic log visualization utilities or scripts
- [ ] Document log sampling and visualization recommendations
- [ ] Add tests for log sampling logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- Log sampling is implemented and configurable
- Documentation includes recommendations for log visualization
- Tests cover log sampling logic
