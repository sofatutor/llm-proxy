# Alerting, Tracing, and Performance Benchmarks

## Summary
Implement alerting recommendations, distributed tracing (optional), and add performance benchmark endpoints for the LLM proxy. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other logging and monitoring enhancements.

## Rationale
- Alerting is essential for operational awareness and incident response.
- Distributed tracing helps diagnose performance and reliability issues in complex deployments.
- Performance benchmarks provide insight into system throughput and latency.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research and document alerting best practices for LLM proxy deployments
- [ ] (Optional) Implement distributed tracing hooks or integration (e.g., OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Add performance benchmark endpoints to the proxy
- [ ] Document alerting, tracing, and benchmarking features
- [ ] Add tests for benchmark endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- Alerting recommendations are documented
- (Optional) Distributed tracing is available and documented
- Performance benchmark endpoints are implemented and tested
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
