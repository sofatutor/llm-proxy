# Proxy and API Tests

## Summary
Proxy and API tests are already present due to ongoing TDD. This issue remains open to further DRY up, refactor, and ensure comprehensive and efficient coverage of all proxy and API logic, keeping coverage above 90% at all times.

## Rationale
- TDD has ensured a strong baseline, but further refactoring can improve test efficiency and maintainability.
- DRYing up and consolidating tests reduces duplication and improves reliability.
- Coverage must remain above 90% at all times.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review and refactor existing proxy and API tests for DRYness and efficiency
- [ ] Ensure all proxy and API logic and edge cases are covered
- [ ] Maintain and improve test coverage reporting
- [ ] Document proxy and API testing best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- Proxy and API tests are DRY, efficient, and comprehensive
- Coverage remains above 90% at all times
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
