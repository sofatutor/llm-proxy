# Docker Optimization

## Summary
Optimize the Dockerfile and containerization setup for the LLM proxy. This includes creating a multi-stage Dockerfile, improving volume configuration, adding container health checks, and implementing security best practices. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other deployment and documentation issues.

## Rationale
- Optimized Docker images improve build speed, security, and runtime performance.
- Proper volume and health check configuration is essential for production deployments.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create a multi-stage Dockerfile for the LLM proxy
- [ ] Improve volume configuration for data, logs, and configuration
- [ ] Add container health checks
- [ ] Implement Docker security best practices (non-root user, minimal image, etc.)
- [ ] Document Docker build and deployment process
- [ ] Add tests for Docker builds and health checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dockerfile is multi-stage and optimized
- Volumes and health checks are properly configured
- Security best practices are followed
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
