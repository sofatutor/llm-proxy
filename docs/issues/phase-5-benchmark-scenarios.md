# Benchmark Scenarios

## Summary
Implement standard benchmark profiles and scenarios for the LLM proxy benchmark tool. This includes progress reporting, customizable request templates, and comprehensive documentation with examples. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other benchmark and performance issues.

## Rationale
- Standard scenarios enable consistent and repeatable performance testing.
- Progress reporting and customizable templates improve usability and flexibility.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement standard benchmark profiles for different scenarios (e.g., low/high concurrency, large/small payloads)
- [ ] Add progress reporting to the benchmark tool
- [ ] Implement customizable request templates
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation with usage examples
- [ ] Add tests for scenario logic and progress reporting

## Acceptance Criteria
- Standard benchmark scenarios are implemented and documented
- Progress reporting and request templates are available
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
