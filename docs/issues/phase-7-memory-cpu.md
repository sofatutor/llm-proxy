# Memory and CPU Optimization

## Summary
Reduce memory allocations, optimize CPU-intensive operations, improve startup time, and fine-tune the LLM proxy for container environments. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other optimization and production readiness issues.

## Rationale
- Efficient memory and CPU usage are essential for performance and cost-effectiveness.
- Fast startup and container optimization improve deployment and scaling.

## Tasks
- [ ] Profile and reduce memory allocations in critical paths
- [ ] Optimize CPU-intensive operations and algorithms
- [ ] Improve application startup time
- [ ] Fine-tune for container environments (resource limits, GC tuning, etc.)
- [ ] Add tests and benchmarks for memory and CPU usage
- [ ] Document memory and CPU optimization strategies

## Acceptance Criteria
- Memory and CPU usage are optimized and tested
- Startup time is improved
- Container-specific optimizations are documented
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
