- [x] Document network security recommendations (TLS, firewall, etc.) (see `docs/deployment/security.md`)
- [x] Document data protection and encryption measures (see `docs/deployment/security.md`)
- [x] Add security troubleshooting and incident response guidance (see `docs/deployment/security.md`)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Security documentation is comprehensive and up to date
- Token, API key, network, and data protection are clearly documented
- Security troubleshooting and incident response guides are available
