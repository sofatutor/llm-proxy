Tracking: [Issue #43](https://github.com/sofatutor/llm-proxy/issues/43)

## Summary
Integrate structured logging, context propagation, and audit logging throughout the LLM proxy application.

    Req([Incoming Request])
    Ctx["Attach Context (trace, user, etc.)"]
    Log["Structured Log Entry"]
    Audit{"Is Security Event?"}
    AuditLog["Write Audit Log"]
    End([Done])

    Req --> Ctx --> Log --> Audit
    Audit -- Yes --> AuditLog --> End
    Audit -- No --> End
```

## Rationale
- Structured logging enables better analysis, filtering, and correlation of logs across distributed systems.
- Log context propagation is essential for tracing requests and debugging.
- Audit logging is required for security and compliance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Add structured logging to all major components and request flows
- [ ] Implement log context propagation (e.g., request IDs, correlation IDs)
- [ ] Create utilities for log search and filtering
- [ ] Set up log aggregation for distributed deployments (e.g., via external log systems)
- [ ] Implement audit logging for security events (e.g., token creation, deletion, access)
- [ ] Document log integration, context propagation, and audit logging
- [ ] Add tests for structured logging and audit logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- All major components use structured logging
- Log context is propagated and available in logs
- Audit logging is implemented for security events
- Utilities for log search/filtering are available
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
