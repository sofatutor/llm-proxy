# Log Integration

## Summary
Integrate structured logging throughout the LLM proxy application. This includes propagating log context, creating utilities for log search and filtering, setting up log aggregation for distributed deployments, and implementing audit logging for security events. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other logging and monitoring enhancements.

## Rationale
- Structured logging enables better analysis, filtering, and correlation of logs across distributed systems.
- Log context propagation is essential for tracing requests and debugging.
- Audit logging is required for security and compliance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Add structured logging to all major components and request flows
- [ ] Implement log context propagation (e.g., request IDs, correlation IDs)
- [ ] Create utilities for log search and filtering
- [ ] Set up log aggregation for distributed deployments (e.g., via external log systems)
- [ ] Implement audit logging for security events (e.g., token creation, deletion, access)
- [ ] Document log integration, context propagation, and audit logging
- [ ] Add tests for structured logging and audit logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- All major components use structured logging
- Log context is propagated and available in logs
- Audit logging is implemented for security events
- Utilities for log search/filtering are available
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
