# Database Tests

## Summary
Many database tests are already present due to ongoing TDD. This issue remains open to further DRY up, refactor, and ensure comprehensive and efficient coverage of all database operations, keeping coverage above 90% at all times.

## Rationale
- TDD has ensured a strong baseline, but further refactoring can improve test efficiency and maintainability.
- DRYing up and consolidating tests reduces duplication and improves reliability.
- Coverage must remain above 90% at all times.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review and refactor existing database tests for DRYness and efficiency
- [ ] Ensure all database operations and edge cases are covered
- [ ] Maintain and improve test coverage reporting
- [ ] Document database testing best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- Database tests are DRY, efficient, and comprehensive
- Coverage remains above 90% at all times
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
