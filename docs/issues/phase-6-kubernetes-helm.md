# Kubernetes Deployment with HELM

## Summary
Create and document Kubernetes deployment configurations for the LLM proxy, including HELM chart creation, secrets management, and production readiness testing. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other deployment and documentation issues.

## Rationale
- Kubernetes is the industry standard for scalable, portable, and reliable container orchestration.
- HELM charts simplify deployment, upgrades, and configuration management.
- Proper secrets management and deployment testing are critical for security and stability.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create Kubernetes manifests for the LLM proxy (Deployment, Service, Ingress, etc.)
- [ ] Develop a HELM chart for easy deployment and configuration
- [ ] Implement secrets management using Kubernetes Secrets or external providers
- [ ] Set up logging, health checks, and autoscaling in Kubernetes
- [ ] Test Kubernetes deployment for functionality, reliability, and scaling
- [ ] Document Kubernetes and HELM deployment process and best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- Kubernetes manifests and HELM chart are available and tested
- Secrets management is implemented and documented
- Logging, health checks, and autoscaling are configured
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
