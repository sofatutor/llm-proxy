# Phase 5 – GitHub Pages Marketing Site & Coverage Publishing

Tracking: To be created on GitHub (Phase 5)

## Summary

Create a static GitHub Pages site (source: `main` / `docs/`) to present LLM Proxy to potential contributors. The site highlights features, screenshots, quickstart, and contributing information, and exposes a Coverage sub‑page generated by CI on every push to `main`.

References:
- PRD: `docs/tasks/prd-github-pages-site.md`
- Tasks: `docs/tasks/tasks-prd-github-pages-site.md`
- Screenshots: `docs/assets/screenshots/`
- Architecture & Docs: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/cli-reference.md`, `docs/instrumentation.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`

## Rationale

- Improve project discoverability and contributor onboarding.
- Provide transparent test coverage as a live artifact.
- Keep maintenance simple by using plain static pages and default Jekyll pipeline.

## Scope

- Pages: Home, Features, Screenshots, Quickstart, Contributing, Coverage (sub‑page), links to Architecture and Roadmap.
- CI: Generate HTML coverage (`docs/coverage/index.html`) from CI-style aggregation and publish to `docs/coverage/` on `main` without workflow loops.
- Badges: Build/Test status and Coverage badge on homepage and `README.md`.
- Assets: Use captured Admin UI screenshots under `docs/assets/screenshots/`.

## Deliverables

- Static site files under `docs/` with simple navigation.
- `.github/workflows/coverage-pages.yml` to publish coverage HTML to `docs/coverage/`.
- Updated `README.md` with badges and link to the site.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GitHub Pages enabled for `main`/`docs/`; site accessible at `https://sofatutor.github.io/llm-proxy`.
- Navbar matches PRD; links and screenshots render correctly.
- Coverage available at `/coverage/` and updated on each push to `main`.
- Badges visible above the fold on homepage and in `README.md`.
- `make test` and `make lint` pass; coverage ≥ 90%.

## Notes

- English only; default domain; no dynamic JS framework.
- Optimize images (≤ 200 KB) and use alt text for accessibility.
