# Benchmark Metrics

## Summary
Implement performance metrics collection and result reporting for the benchmark tool. This includes latency statistics, throughput, error rates, connection statistics, and support for multiple output formats (console, JSON, CSV, visualization). This issue can be worked on in parallel with other benchmark and performance issues.

## Rationale
- Detailed metrics are essential for understanding and optimizing proxy performance.
- Multiple output formats enable integration with other tools and workflows.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement collection of latency, throughput, error rates, and connection statistics
- [ ] Add support for result reporting in console, JSON, and CSV formats
- [ ] Implement basic visualization options (optional)
- [ ] Add comparison features for different benchmark runs
- [ ] Document metrics collection and reporting features
- [ ] Add tests for metrics and reporting logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- Benchmark tool collects and reports all required metrics
- Multiple output formats are supported and tested
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
