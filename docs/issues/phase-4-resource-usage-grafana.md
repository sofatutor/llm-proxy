## Tasks
- [ ] Implement resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, etc.)
- [ ] Create (optional) dashboard templates for Grafana
- [ ] Document resource usage monitoring and dashboard setup
- [ ] Add tests for resource usage monitoring endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- Resource usage monitoring is implemented and tested
- (Optional) Grafana dashboard templates are available and documented
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
