# Testing Framework

## Summary
The core testing framework and utilities for the LLM proxy are already largely in place due to ongoing TDD. This issue remains open as an opportunity to DRY up, refactor, and optimize tests, and to ensure coverage remains above 90% at all times. Focus is on test efficiency, maintainability, and CI integration.

## Rationale
- TDD has ensured a robust foundation, but ongoing refactoring can improve test efficiency and maintainability.
- DRYing up test code reduces duplication and makes future changes easier.
- Coverage must remain above 90% at all times, enforced by CI.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review and refactor existing test helpers, mocks, and fixtures for DRYness
- [ ] Optimize and consolidate test setup/teardown logic
- [ ] Ensure all new and existing code is covered by tests (90%+)
- [ ] Maintain and improve test coverage reporting and CI integration
- [ ] Document best practices for writing and maintaining tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- Test code is DRY, efficient, and maintainable
- Coverage remains above 90% at all times
- CI integration for coverage is robust
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
