# SecOps Automation: Security Scanning & Reporting

## Summary
Implement automated security operations (SecOps) for the LLM proxy project, including Docker image scanning, source code security analysis, and automated reporting of new vulnerabilities via GitHub Actions.

    Start([Code/Image Update or Schedule])
    ScanDocker["Scan Docker Image (Scout/Trivy)"]
    ScanCode["Scan Source Code (CodeQL/Semgrep)"]
    ScanArch["Scan Architecture (Checkov/kube-score)"]
    Report["Generate Security Report"]
    Issues["Create GitHub Issue if New Vulnerability"]
    Notify["Notify Team"]
    End([Security Issue Tracked])

    Start --> ScanCode
    Start --> ScanArch
    ScanDocker --> Report
    ScanCode --> Report
    ScanArch --> Report
    Report --> Issues --> Notify --> End
```

## Rationale
- Proactive security scanning is essential for production readiness and compliance.
- Automated workflows ensure vulnerabilities are detected and reported promptly, reducing risk and manual effort.
- Using industry-standard tools (e.g., Docker Scout, Trivy, CodeQL) ensures best-in-class coverage and reliability.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up Docker image security scanning in GitHub Actions (e.g., Docker Scout, Trivy)
- [ ] Schedule daily security scans of Docker images via GitHub Actions
- [ ] Configure workflow to automatically create a new GitHub issue if new vulnerabilities are found
- [ ] Integrate source code security scanning (e.g., GitHub CodeQL, Semgrep)
- [ ] Add architectural security analysis using industry-standard tools (e.g., Checkov for IaC, kube-score for Kubernetes manifests)
- [ ] Document all security scanning workflows and how to interpret results
- [ ] Add tests to ensure security workflows are triggered and reporting as expected

    participant GH as GitHub Actions
    participant Scanner as Security Scanner
    participant Repo as Repository
    participant Issues as GitHub Issues
    GH->>Scanner: Run Scheduled/Daily Scan
    Scanner->>Repo: Analyze Code & Images
    Scanner-->>GH: Return Results
    GH->>Issues: Create Issue if New Vulnerability
    Issues-->>GH: Issue Created/Updated
    GH->>Team: Notify via Issue/Alert
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- Docker images are scanned daily for vulnerabilities; new issues are created automatically for new findings
- Source code and infrastructure are scanned for security issues using industry-standard tools
- All security scanning workflows are documented and tested
- Security issues are tracked and resolved promptly
