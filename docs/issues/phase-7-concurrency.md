# Concurrency Optimization

## Summary
Optimize the use of goroutines and concurrency throughout the LLM proxy, including connection pooling and worker pools where appropriate. Improve resource utilization and throughput. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other optimization and production readiness issues.

## Rationale
- Efficient concurrency is essential for high throughput and low latency in Go applications.
- Connection pooling and worker pools help manage resources and avoid bottlenecks.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review and optimize goroutine usage in request handling, background tasks, and cleanup operations
- [ ] Implement or improve connection pooling for database and HTTP clients
- [ ] Add worker pools for concurrent request processing where appropriate
- [ ] Add tests and benchmarks for concurrency improvements
- [ ] Document concurrency patterns and optimizations

## Acceptance Criteria
- Concurrency is optimized for all major components
- Connection pooling and worker pools are implemented and tested
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
