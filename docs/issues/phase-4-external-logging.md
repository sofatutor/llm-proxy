# External Logging

## Summary
Implement the asynchronous external logging worker for the LLM proxy. This includes buffered sending, retry mechanisms, batch processing, and error handling for forwarding logs to external systems (e.g., Helicone, or other backends). This issue can be worked on in parallel with other logging and monitoring enhancements.

## Rationale
- Asynchronous external logging enables integration with observability platforms and log aggregation systems without blocking the main proxy path.
- Buffered and batched sending improves performance and reliability.
- Retry and error handling are required for robustness in production environments.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design the architecture for the asynchronous external logging worker
- [ ] Implement buffered sending of logs to external systems
- [ ] Add batch processing for efficient log delivery
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed log deliveries
- [ ] Add error handling and fallback to local logging if external delivery fails
- [ ] Add configuration options for enabling/disabling external logging, buffer size, batch size, and retry policy
- [ ] Add unit tests for the external logging worker
- [ ] Document the external logging system and configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- Logs can be sent asynchronously to external systems without blocking the main proxy path
- Buffered and batched delivery is implemented and configurable
- Retry and error handling are robust and tested
- External logging can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
