# External Logging Worker (Deprecated)

## Status
This component has been **removed** and replaced by the new three-part observability architecture:
- [Generic Async Observability Middleware](phase-4-generic-async-middleware.md)
- [Async Event Bus](phase-4-async-event-bus.md)
- [Event Dispatcher Service](phase-4-event-dispatcher-service.md)

## Rationale
The new architecture provides better separation of concerns, extensibility, and compliance with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). All external logging and observability is now handled via the async event bus and pluggable dispatcher services.
