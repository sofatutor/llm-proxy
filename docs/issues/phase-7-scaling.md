# Scaling Support

## Summary
Implement scaling support for the LLM proxy, including load balancing for API keys, distributed rate limiting, and documentation for scaling considerations and zero-downtime deployment. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other optimization and production readiness issues.

## Rationale
- Scaling support is essential for high-availability, high-throughput, and production-grade deployments.
- Distributed rate limiting and load balancing improve reliability and performance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement load balancing for multiple API keys
- [ ] Add distributed rate limiting (e.g., Redis-backed)
- [ ] Document scaling considerations (horizontal/vertical, database, load balancing)
- [ ] Create zero-downtime deployment strategy and documentation
- [ ] Add tests for scaling features

## Acceptance Criteria
- Load balancing and distributed rate limiting are implemented and tested
- Scaling and deployment strategies are documented
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
