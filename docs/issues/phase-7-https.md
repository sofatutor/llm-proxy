# HTTPS and Security

## Summary
Add HTTPS support to the LLM proxy, including TLS configuration, certificate management (using Let's Encrypt), and HTTP/2 support. The proxy will support HTTPS termination directly and can forward requests to the admin server (e.g., on a /admin path). HTTPS/TLS configuration, including Let's Encrypt, will be handled via CLI or environment options for the server command. This enables cookie-based session authentication for both the admin UI and the proxy. Enhance security features as needed. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other optimization and production readiness issues.

## Rationale
- HTTPS is required for secure communication and compliance.
- HTTP/2 improves performance and compatibility with modern clients.
- Direct HTTPS termination at the proxy simplifies deployment and enables secure, cookie-based session authentication for both the admin UI and the proxy.
- Let's Encrypt provides free, automated certificate management, reducing operational overhead.
- CLI/ENV options make configuration flexible and suitable for automated deployments.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement TLS configuration and certificate management (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Add support for HTTP/2
- [ ] Add option to terminate HTTPS directly on the proxy
- [ ] Enable forwarding to the admin server on a configurable path (e.g., /admin)
- [ ] Support CLI/ENV options for HTTPS/TLS and Let's Encrypt configuration in the server command
- [ ] Support cookie-based session authentication for both admin and proxy endpoints
- [ ] Enhance security features as needed (e.g., stricter headers, improved auth)
- [ ] Document HTTPS and security configuration, including Let's Encrypt setup
- [ ] Add tests for HTTPS and security features

## Acceptance Criteria
- HTTPS and HTTP/2 are supported and tested
- Proxy can terminate HTTPS and forward to the admin server on a configurable path
- Let's Encrypt is supported for automated certificate management
- HTTPS/TLS and Let's Encrypt can be configured via CLI/ENV options for the server command
- Cookie-based session authentication is supported for both admin and proxy
- Security features are enhanced and documented
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
