# HTTPS and Security

## Summary
Add HTTPS support to the LLM proxy, including TLS configuration, certificate management, and HTTP/2 support. Enhance security features as needed. This issue can be worked on in parallel with other optimization and production readiness issues.

## Rationale
- HTTPS is required for secure communication and compliance.
- HTTP/2 improves performance and compatibility with modern clients.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement TLS configuration and certificate management
- [ ] Add support for HTTP/2
- [ ] Enhance security features as needed (e.g., stricter headers, improved auth)
- [ ] Document HTTPS and security configuration
- [ ] Add tests for HTTPS and security features

## Acceptance Criteria
- HTTPS and HTTP/2 are supported and tested
- Security features are enhanced and documented
- Documentation and tests are updated accordingly
