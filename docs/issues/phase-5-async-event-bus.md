# Async Event Bus (Redis/In-Memory Backend)

## Summary
Develop an asynchronous event bus component to buffer, batch, and deliver instrumentation events from the middleware to one or more downstream consumers. Support both in-memory and Redis backends for flexibility and scalability.

## Rationale
- Decouples event production from event consumption.
- Enables scalable, reliable delivery to multiple dispatchers/services.
- Supports both local development (in-memory) and production (Redis) use cases.

## Requirements
- Support for both in-memory and Redis backends (configurable)
- Thread-safe, non-blocking event ingestion
- Batching and retry logic for delivery
- Subscription model for multiple consumers
- Metrics and health checks

## Tasks
- [ ] Design event bus interface and backend abstraction
- [ ] Implement in-memory backend
- [ ] Implement Redis backend
- [ ] Add batching, retry, and health check logic
- [ ] Support multiple subscribers/dispatchers
- [ ] Write tests for both backends
- [ ] Document configuration and usage

## Acceptance Criteria
- Event bus works with both in-memory and Redis
- Supports multiple subscribers
- Reliable, async delivery with batching and retries
- Tests and documentation are complete
